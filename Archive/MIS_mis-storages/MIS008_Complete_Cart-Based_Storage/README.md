This MIS storage system uses hoppercarts to allow for up to 16x hopper-speed sorting. Includes: Cart MIS V3, Cart Single-Item Hybrid Sorters, Command Leo's 1.20 Ultimate Unstackable Sorter.
## Features
- Each of the 32 MIS category (1-wide) holds up to 50 different item types. There are 216 hybrid box loaders holding a single item type.
- Up to 16x hopper-speed sorting (6x average)
- Single input for loose items and shulker boxes (unloaded and preserved)
- Much more unload resistant than MIS V4/V5
- Includes Cart MIS V3
- Includes Cart Single-Item Hybrid Sorters
- Includes Command Leo's 1.20 Ultimate Unstackable Sorter
## Considerations
- Limited to 1x hopperspeed per MIS category, but can load multiple categories simultaneously.
- Some rail placements may be difficult to build
