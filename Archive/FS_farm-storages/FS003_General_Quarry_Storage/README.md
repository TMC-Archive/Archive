Sorts and stores items produced by a quarry
## Features
- Comes in 3 schematics: stack separation sorter, sorter + deepslate loaders, sorter + storage.
- Sorter and storage are configured for an average mesa quarry in 1.18+ using VDQ v2.
- Sorter can handle a 500 wide quarry (wider as well, but that hasn't been tested).
## Notes
- World download also includes instructions for running quarry with the sorter, please read those.
- Note that it doesn't collect all produced deepslate, only up to 8mil.
- Storage is configured to handle a 500x1500 area.
- With the schematics an example setup is attached, which includes a quarry, nether transportation line and the storage.
