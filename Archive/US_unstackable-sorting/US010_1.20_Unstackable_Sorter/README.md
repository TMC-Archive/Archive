Sorts 1.20+ unstackable items by their item type. Can sort between 11 unstackable items.
## Features
- 11 items sorted: music discs, enchanted books, bottles, flint and steel, shears, powdered snow, lava bucket, water bucket, boat, armor, and cart.
- Compact:  6x6x13 vs 6x9x14 compared to [US001 CommandLeo's 1.20 Unstackable Sorter](https://discord.com/channels/1375556143186837695/1465717428930478120)
- Lag efficient: no pistons in clocks and locking, no 4gt clocks (they're laggy asf), every clock is independent.
- Dropper layout optimised for 1.20.
- Hopper speed throughput
- 31 hoppers vs 45 hoppers compared to [US001 CommandLeo's 1.20 Unstackable Sorter](https://discord.com/channels/1375556143186837695/1465717428930478120)
- Fully hopperlocked and idle cartless version included.
## Considerations
- Large salmon can escape from fish containment. Don't put in buckets containing large salmon.
- Brushes go in the shears chest in 1.21+
## Notes
Schematic contains four variants in different subregions. See subregion names to identify them.

1.20+
