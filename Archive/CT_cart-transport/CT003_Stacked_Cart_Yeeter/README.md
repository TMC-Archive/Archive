This cart yeeter supports stacked carts as input.
## Features
- Stacked cart compatible
- Outputs inventory items and cart items separately in item entity form
## Notes
- The cart item has enough rightwards momentum that you can replace the glass block next to the cauldron with soul sand, and bubble column the cart item up directly.
## Instructions
1. You must use a waterlogged chest or ender chest block, it's the only hitbox that works reliably. The waterlogging is necessary to make sure the cart items don't burn in the lava cauldron.
2. The stacked carts must be locked with an activator rail before yeeting. otherwise they can pick up items and result in carts leaking to item output.
3. The wall must be flat without a middle post for proper cart alignment.
4. The carts must have enough momentum to hit the wall before snapping onto the rail.
