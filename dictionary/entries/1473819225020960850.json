  "definition": "Pipelining (also referred to as hyperthreading), is design paradigm where a process with multiple steps can occur simultaneously with another process at a later stage. A process here can refer to a cycle in a cycvar, or any other repeatable sequence which has multiple steps. The goal of pipelining is to increase how often you can run a process without having to reduce how long it takes to finish a single process. This effectively increases the throughput without decreasing the latency.",
