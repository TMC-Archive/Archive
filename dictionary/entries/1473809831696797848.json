  "definition": "A box matcher is a device which checks if a specific item type is contained in a box. The box can be a mixed box, in which a match means that a slot in the box has the desired item type. Box matchers typically work by putting from the box with a hopper filter, if it can pull an item out, then it means that the box is a match, otherwise it is rejected. The item that is pulled out is recombined with the box afterwards. A variable matcher which sets the filter type dynamically is called a grouper.",
